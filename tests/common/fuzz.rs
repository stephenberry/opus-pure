//! The bodies of the fuzz targets in [`fuzz/`][f].
//!
//! They live here, in the tracked test helpers, rather than in the fuzz crate,
//! for the same reason the reference harnesses include this directory rather
//! than copying it: a body that only the fuzzer can run is a body no ordinary
//! test can replay. `fuzz_corpus.rs` runs every one of these over the tracked
//! corpus on `cargo test`, so an input that once crashed the decoder keeps
//! being checked long after the fuzzing session that found it is over, and on
//! platforms the fuzzer does not run on.
//!
//! Each body decides what its input *means* — which sample rate, where one
//! packet ends and the next begins — from the bytes themselves, so that the
//! fuzzer's mutations reach the decoder's configuration as well as its
//! bitstream. The rule is that no input may panic, hang, or produce a
//! non-finite sample; beyond that, each body asserts the contracts a caller is
//! entitled to rely on, because a decoder that quietly disagrees with
//! [`packet::samples`] about a packet's duration is a defect even though it
//! never crashes.
//!
//! [f]: https://github.com/stephenberry/opus-pure/tree/main/fuzz

// Each fuzz target includes this file on its own and calls one of the bodies,
// so from inside the fuzz crate the other two always look unused.
